IAM - Identity and Access Management
	- This is a Global Service, not a region specific --> changes made here are applied to all regions
	- create users, groups, assign users to groups, etc
	- 
	
	
Root Account: created by default (not to be shared and shouldn't be used), to be used for set-up only
Users: people within your organization, can be grouped (user don't have to belong to a group and user can belong to multiple groups)
Groups: can contain only users (not other groups)

Users and Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
Policies define permissions of the users (what a user/users in group are allowed to do)

LEAST PRIVILEGE PRINCIPLE: don't give more permissions than user needs
{don't allow everyone to do everything}

One AWS user = One physical user {Don't share credentials}


User Group:
	- create new group
	- grant privileges/roles/access to new group (permissions can be given to groups or users - best practice is using groups)

Create user:
	- access type (aws mgmt console access) 
		{programatic access generates access key ID and secret key - used for programatic access like API}
		{other than console, AWS can be accessed using CLI or SDK using access-key-ID and secret-key}
		CLI=Command Line Interface, SDK= Software Development Kit
	- console password (either custom or autogenerated), can be set to "Require password reset" on first login
	- add user to group (group permissions are applied) OR copy permissions from other users OR attach existing policies directly
	- add tags to user [tags are seen across the AWS for the user], it is key-value pair for storing information about entity (user) such as email, job role, etc
	- user details can be mailed to newly created user once user is created (or csv file can be downloaded)
	- all users other than root are called IAM users
	
IAM user login URL:
	- it is different than root login URL : https://{accountID}.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
	- account alias (for user friendly / readable) can be added after which IAM user login URL becomes : https://{accountAlias}.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
	- account alias should be unique accross all the accounts accross the globe
	
----------------- user security ------------------------------------
Account Settings

Password Policy (must be strong):
	- Strong password policy can be set-up for IAM users
		-> minimum length of password
		-> specific characters
			* uppercase
			* lowercase
			* number
			* non-alphanumeric characters
		-> Allow IAM users to change passwords at their own
		-> Passowrd expiry
		-> prevent re-use passwords
	

MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) {enforce user to use MFA is recommended}:
	- password + security device
	- MFA devices
		$ Click on Account Name --> My Security Credentials --> MFA --> Activate MFA
		$ Copy/Snapshot QR code save it safe (in case of device change, MFA will be setup on new device/phone by scanning this QR code)
		
		-> virtual device [ (Google Authenticator - phone only) OR ( Authy - multi device, multiple tokens on same device)
		-> Universal 2nf Factor (U2F) security key - physical device
		-> Other Device

----------------- Policy ------------------------------------
Policies (pre-defined permissions by AWS):
	- Goto Policy --> open any policy --> permissions (in JSON format too) can be viewed in Summary window
	
	e.g.
	- IAMReadOnlyAccess : read only access, cannot modify user groups or users

Create Policy (custom defined) - either visual editor or JSON
	$ visual editor (JSON gets created automatically):
		* choose a service
		* select actions 
		* select access level
---------------------------------------------------------------------		
		
---------------- Roles -------------------------------------------------

-AWS services need to perform actions on your behalf
-AWS services are granted permissions using IAM Roles

-Common Roles
	# EC2 Instance Roles
	# Lambda Function Roles
	# Roles for CloudFormation

-Create Roles
	- select service/s for which role is to be created
	- assign policy

---------------- Audit -------------------------------------------------
Credential report
	- Audit of permissions granted
	- Account level report
