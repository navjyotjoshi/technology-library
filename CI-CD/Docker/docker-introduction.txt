Docker - Makes really easy to install and run applications without worrying about set-up or dependencies

Docker Ecosystem consists of:
  Docker Client
  Docker Server
  Docker Hub
  Docker Images
  Docker Machine
  Docker Compose

Docker - Platform or ecosystem for creating and running containers
Container - An instance of an image, runs a program
Image - Single file (including codebase/build) with all required configs and dependencies

Docker contains Unix/Linux virtual machine built-in, on which all containers run.

Docker client - receives commands from user/developer
Docker server (virtual) - receives commands from docker client and runs image from image cache
Image cache - storage area where all images are stored

Docker Hub - Public Image storage (like github public repositories) from where an image can be imported
